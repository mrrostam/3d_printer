# This file contains pin mappings for the stock Sovol SV06
# To use this config, during "make menuconfig" select the
# STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader" and serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) communication.
# Also, since it is using the GD32F103, please select Disable SWD at startup
#
# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.
#
# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
